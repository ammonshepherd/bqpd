# Deployment Web Application

This application allows you to create projects (websites) and then create tasks
to do on that project.

This is mainly developed for grabbing a git repository and cloning it to a
production server, and then running the tasks to complete the setup of the site
for production.

# Development

Clone the repo 

`git clone https://github.com/mossiso/bqpd`

Install gems

`bundle`

Start the web service

`rails s`
